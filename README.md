This project is an online shop that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The project aims to create a realistic and interactive shopping experience for users through a command-line interface. Users can buy and sell different kinds of products, such as books, electronics, clothing, etc. Users can also manage their accounts, carts, and orders. The project also allows users to register as sellers and add their own products to the shop. Sellers can set their own prices, descriptions, and categories for their products. Sellers can also view and update their inventory, sales, and earnings. The project showcases the benefits of OOP, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, in designing and implementing a complex and modular system.
